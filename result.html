        <h4 class="text-dark">What is it?</h4>
        <p>Chilli leaf curl virus is a DNA virus from the genus Begomovirus and
            family Geminiviridae.</p>
            <h4 class="text-dark">What deficiency causes leaf curl in chilli leaf?</h4>
            <p>When plants lack calcium, leaves cannot develop properly and will
                begin to appear curled or bubbly.</p>
        <h4 class="text-dark">Symptoms</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Upward curling, puckering, and bunching of leaves</li>
            <li>The leaves are also reduced in size</li>
            <li>Severely affected plants produce fewer, smaller, and deformed
                fruits</li>
            <li>Significant yield losses</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-dark">How to Control</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Apply Carbofuran 3G @ 4-5 Kg/acre in the main field to control
                sucking complex and insect vectors selectively</li>
                <li>Spray the crop with systemic insecticides, Dimethoate 2ml of
                    Acephate 1g per litre of water.</li>

            <h4 class="text-dark">What is it?</h4>
            <p>Anthracnose disease is caused by Colletotrichum species which
                belongs to the Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Ascomycota, Class
                Sordariomycetes; Order Phyllachorales; and Family Phyllachoraceae.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Minor cosmetic spotting of leaves</li>

                <li>Spots become necrotic with brown centre with chlorotic borders</li>

            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-dark">How to Control</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Seed treatment - thiram 2 kg/ha or zineb 2.5 kg/ha</li>
                <li>Three sprayings with captan 0.2 %- 1st spraying - just before
                    flowering, 2nd at the time of fruit formation and 3rd - fortnight
                    interval after second spraying.</li>
                <li>Polymyxa C1 effectively controlled the anthracnose disease on
                    chili pepper cultivar Cabe Besar, and can be recommended for
                    field testing before it is used widely in the field.</li>
